**ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Carlos, a Graphic Software Developer**

Iâ€™ve been leading the design and implementation of a company's core application: A **3D CAD** software based on **OpenGL** and **C#** as main technologies, also, I'm responsable for shaders application under **GLSL** to improve visualizations and some **C++** libraries to integrate functionalities in the software. Another projects for the company include **OpenCV** library development to give *"eyes"* to a movable robot.

Personal projects to keep myself updated include a basic course in *Vulkan*, ray tracing algorithm implementation from zero in *C++*, *some WebGL* tests, and a game with *C++* and *OpenGL*, among others.
